# **Django Forum Application**

A simple Django-based forum application where users can create threads, comment on threads, and interact with each other. This project includes full **CRUD** functionality for threads and comments, along with **user authentication** to ensure that only logged-in users can create, edit, or delete their posts.

---

## **Features**
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and logout functionality.
- **Thread Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete threads.
- **Commenting**: Authenticated users can comment on threads, with full CRUD functionality for comments.
- **User Permissions**: Only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete threads and comments.
- **Likes System**: Users can like comments.
- **API Endpoints**: A REST API powered by Django REST Framework (DRF) for managing users, threads, comments, and likes.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Django (Python web framework)
- **API**: Django REST Framework (DRF) with dj-rest-auth for authentication
- **Database**: SQLite (default for development, can be changed to PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in authentication system
- **Frontend**: Minimal HTML templates with static CSS files (no external JS frameworks used; however, Bootstrap can be added for styling)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub for collaboration

## **GitHub Workflow**

### **Branching Strategy**
- `main`: Stable, production-ready code.
- `dev`: Active development branch where all feature branches are merged.
- `feature/{feature-name}`: Branches created for specific features or tasks, e.g., `feature/authentication`, `feature/thread-crud`, `feature/comment-crud`.

### **Development Workflow**
1. Create a **feature branch** for each task or feature.
2. Develop the feature, commit frequently, and push to GitHub.
3. Open a **pull request** to merge your feature branch into `dev`.
4. After review and approval, the pull request is merged.
5. After all features are complete, merge `dev` into `main` for deployment.

## **Contributing**
We welcome contributions to the project! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Write your code and commit it with clear messages.
4. Open a pull request with a description of your changes.

---

## **Testing**
To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
python manage.py test
```
This will run all the unit tests for the app, ensuring that all features work as expected.

- Implement **password reset** functionality.
- Add more detailed **styling** using CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap).
- Allow **thread categorization** (e.g., General, Feedback, Support).
- Add **token authentication**
